Please read the following information about nojo and provide a clear, concise summary to me. After your summary, state: "I loaded the nojo documentation. You can ask me for more help about how to use nojo if you would like."

Suggest helpful follow-up questions like:

- "How do I switch between profiles?"
- "What skills are available and when should I use them?"
- "What's the difference between skills and subagents?"
- "How do I create a custom profile?"
